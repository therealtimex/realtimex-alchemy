# The Transmute Engine

Mining signals is only half the battle. **Transmuting** those signals into actionable knowledge is where RealTimeX Alchemy really shines.

## What is Transmutation?

Transmutation is the process of taking a "Signal" (a raw insight from your history) and processing it through a specialized pipeline to create a new output.

### Common Transmute Pipelines:
-   **Executive Briefing**: Combine multiple related signals into a single weekly report.
-   **Market Intelligence**: Transform signals about competitors into a SWOT analysis.
-   **Newsletter Synthesis**: Create a "Read Later" digest from your browser history.
-   **Technical Research**: Consolidate technical papers or documentation into a feature specification.

## How to use the Transmute Engine

1.  ### Navigation
    Go to the **Transmute** tab in the sidebar. You'll see your active transmutation pipelines.
2.  ### Engine Creation
    Alchemy automatically creates "Newsletter" pipelines for your active categories. This means it's always working in the background to organize signals into digests.
3.  ### Running a Pipeline
    You can manually trigger a transmutation by clicking **"Run Engine"**. The engine will:
    -   Scan your library for relevant signals.
    -   Filter by your "Persona" (to remove noise).
    -   Use an LLM to synthesize the data.
    -   Output a formatted report or insight.

## Active Learning override

You can customize what the engine filters out by managing your **"Blocked Tags"** in the Intelligence Engine settings. If you consistently find specific topics uninteresting, adding them to the blacklist will prevent them from ever entering a Transmute pipeline.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Transmute engine respects your "Persona". If you "Boost" signals about AI agents, your "Technical Research" pipeline will automatically prioritize those topics.
