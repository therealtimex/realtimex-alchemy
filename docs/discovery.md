# Discovery: Exploring Your Intelligence Feed

The **Discovery** tab is where you browse the insights "transmuted" from your reading history.

## The Discovery Tab Layout

### 1. New Signals Feed
At the top, you'll find a horizontal feed of the most recently discovered signals. This feed is collapsible to save space.

### 2. Category Grid
Signals are automatically categorized. You'll see cards for common categories like:
-   **Internal Product Strategy**: Technical decisions, roadmaps.
-   **Competitor Intel**: News about rivals.
-   **Macro Trends**: Industry-wide shifts.
-   **Technology Breakthroughs**: New tools or scientific papers.

### 3. Filters and Search
-   **Search Bar**: Search through signal titles, summaries, and tags.
-   **Category Filter**: Click a category in the grid to see only signals in that group.
-   **Score Filter**: (Found in System Logs > Found Signals) Filter by "High Impact" (80%+ score).

## Managing Signals

Each signal card provides a snapshot of the content. Clicking a card opens the **Signal Drawer**:

-   **Executive Summary**: A concise breakdown of the source.
-   **Entities**: People, companies, and technologies mentioned.
-   **Boost/Dismiss**: Use these buttons to train the AI. "Boosting" tells Alchemy this is high-value; "Dismissing" hides similar content in the future.
-   **Favorite**: Keep a signal for permanent reference.
-   **Notes**: Add your own thoughts or context to a signal.
-   **External Link**: Jump to the original source URL.

## Automatic Category Generation

Alchemy is smart. If you encounter a specific topic frequently (e.g., "Quantum Computing" or "React Server Components"), it will automatically promote that tag into a top-level category in your Discovery grid.
