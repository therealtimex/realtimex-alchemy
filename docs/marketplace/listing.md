## Full Description

### 🧪 Transmute Your Information Intake
**RealTimeX Alchemy** is not just another bookmarks manager or note-taking app. It is a **Passive Intelligence Engine** that works in the background while you explore the web, automatically identifying high-value signals and organizing them into a structured knowledge base.

### 🚀 Key Features

-   **Passive Signal Mining**: Alchemy silently explores your browser history (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Brave) to find the articles, research, and documentation you've actually spent time with.
-   **AI-Powered Scoring**: Using the **RealTimeX SDK**, Alchemy scores every discovered URL based on your custom "Persona," filtering out the noise and highlighting the "Gold."
-   **Knowledge Transmutation**: Convert ephemeral signals into permanent knowledge. Alchemy extracts core concepts, summaries, and technical data automatically.
-   **Intelligent Chat**: Talk to your history. Alchemy's integrated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) allows you to query your entire mined knowledge base directly.
-   **Live Terminal Feedback**: Watch the alchemy happen in real-time with a terminal-style feed of discovery, scoring, and analysis events.

### 🛡️ Privacy-First: Own Your Database
Alchemy follows the **"Own Your Database"** philosophy. All your mined signals, embeddings, and chat history are stored in **your own Supabase instance**. RealTimeX never sees your data.

### 🔌 RealTimeX Desktop Integration
Designed to run as a **Local App**, Alchemy leverages the global AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, etc.) configured in your **RealTimeX Desktop** environment. No messy API key management within the app—it just works.
